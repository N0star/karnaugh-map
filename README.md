# Karnaugh Map

The program that I made for my end-of-term exam. The licence's thesis was "A computer implementation of Karnaugh tables method".
It simplify functions using this method for up to 8 variables. After getting [minterms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_normal_form#Minterm) from user it returns results and the 2D view of the Karnaugh map.
